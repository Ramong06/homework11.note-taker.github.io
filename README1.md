# Deployment
This homework was assigned to me by the University of Texas at University of Houston.  It's purpose is to create a Note-Taker.  In this application the user should be able to type in some notes,
save them for later and eventually delete them when ready.  When entering info (notes) into the designated field, the user can click the save icon to save them.  After the user no longer needs 
those notes the user can click the delete icon to delete the notes.
